# Alexander Cimini – Project Repository

Welcome to my personal repository showcasing a collection of completed and ongoing projects. Each project reflects my interests and skills across financial engineering, data science, and software development. Below, you'll find descriptions outlining the purpose and objectives of each initiative.

## [Forecasting Day-ahead Expected Shortfall on the EUR/USD Exchange Rate](https://github.com/ACimini/Projects/blob/main/Forecasting%20Day%20Ahead%20USD-EUR%20VaR/EUR-USD%20Report.pdf)

In this project, we replicate and extend the findings of a recent paper on the best models for forecasting Expected Shortfall (ES) for EUR/USD foreign exchange returns (Lyócsa et. al). We check whether incorporating implied volatility information from options markets improves these risk forecasts. Our empirical strategy is based on a comparison of the performances of two groups of models: one that relies only on historical realized price measures, such as Exponential GARCH and quantile regression models, and another that supplements those with implied volatilities from options with daily, weekly, and monthly maturities. We adhere to the methodology of the original paper using strict ES regression-based backtesting and joint ES evaluation frameworks to validate our models. Our findings attempt to reproduce the original while contributing to knowledge regarding the added value of implied volatility in enhancing the accuracy of risk forecasting.

## [Price Forecasting Using Machine Learning Analysis](https://github.com/ACimini/Projects/blob/main/Stock%20Price%20Forecasting%20using%20ML/Price%20Forecasting%20Analysis%20FINAL.pdf)

Understanding and predicting stock price movements is a critical challenge in financial markets. This project seeks to address the research question: Can an LSTM accurately forecast the day ahead Microsoft stock closing price using historical price data and additional market indicators? To answer this, a machine-learning model was developed to predict the closing price of Microsoft stock one day ahead.


## [Portfolio Replication using The Binomial Tree Method to Accurately Price Options](https://github.com/ACimini/Projects/blob/main/Portfolio%20Replication%20using%20The%20Binomial%20Tree%20Method%20to%20Accurately%20Price%20Options/Portfolio%20Replication%20using%20The%20Binomial%20Tree%20Method%20to%20Accurately%20Price%20Options.pdf)

The motivation for exploring portfolio replication techniques as a method for option pricing stems from several key considerations natural in modern financial markets.
