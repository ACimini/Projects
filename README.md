# Alexander Cimini â€“ Project Repository

Welcome to my personal repository showcasing a collection of completed and ongoing projects. Each project reflects my interests and skills across financial engineering, data science, and software development. Below, you'll find descriptions outlining the purpose and objectives of each initiative.

## [WTW Market Price Prediction Model (Capstone)](https://github.com/ACimini/Projects/blob/main/WTW%20Market%20Pricing%20Broker%20Tool/WTW%20Final%20Report.pdf)

This project, conducted in collaboration with Willis Towers Watson (WTW), developed a predictive model for analyzing rate relativities and premiums across excess casualty insurance towers. Using a dataset of anonymized client towers, the team employed statistical models to model the relationships between layer limits, attachment points, and premiums. The model captured key non-linear trends in tower structures and achieved a strong predictive accuracy. The final deliverable was a broker and underwriter-friendly Excel tool with an R backend, enabling dynamic scenario testing and pricing analysis. This project highlights how these modern statistical methods can enhance pricing strategies in a dynamic excess casualty insurance market and provide a foundation for ongoing model refinement through expanded data sources and market integration.
